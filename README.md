# Project Slide Design

If the goal of your presentationn is to convince an employer of your credability, you do not want anything distracting from your work. Design aspects can be distracting, particularly:
- inconsistencies in style
- heavy text & clutter
- messy visualizations

## Learning goals
In this lesson, you will:

- identify what slide components count as "style"
- to describe the impact of a slide template
- declutter slides by removing excessive text and redundant visualizations
- define the characteristics of a "complete" visualization

## Identify what slide components count as "style"
The goal of your presentation is to convey a _professional_ **style**. A _professional_ presentation style demonstrates that you pay attention to detail and are aware how the _design_ of your slides will impact the viewer as much a _content_. Font choices, font consistency, font size consistency, choice of colors, and choice of graphics all contribute to the design and style of your presentation. Your **choices** and **consistency** can either enhance or distract from your material. 
**Challenges** Most slides have unprofessional style: cluttered, text- or jargon-heavy, visuals that are dense, unclear or unnecessary

### The messy example


### 
**Goal**: All presentation slides have a professional style.

Design: How to find and use templates, how to set up slides cleanly, and how to think through making effective visualizations

## Declutter slides by removing excessive text and redundant visualizations
Challenges: Visualizations are a mess
Solution: Checklist of things to think about, Python GraphViz link

## Define the characteristics of a "complete" visualization

### Slide review:
On the slide [X] of the messy presentation[or maybe just "in this sample visualization from the messy presentation and show image], there are 4 aspects that if fixed, would enhance the credibility of this presentation. Take a moment to see if you can identify what is missing from this visualization.

### The identified issues


### What every visual should have
Challenges: A lot of text or jargon
Solution: Less text, more visuals

Checklist of how we went from messy to polished
